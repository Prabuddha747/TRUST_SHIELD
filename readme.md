# TrustShield - Transforming Digital Trust Through Tech Innovation and Ethical Practices 

<h2>Abstract:</h2> 
"TrustShield" is a cutting-edge initiative dedicated to enhancing digital confidence by addressing three 
critical challenges in online transactions. The Hidden Cost Detector, driven by advanced algorithms and 
machine learning, unveils obscured charges within transaction details, fostering transparency and integrity. 
Simultaneously, TrustShield's system targets Misleading Product Information, meticulously scrutinising 
listings to ensure accurate and comprehensive details, thereby promoting transparency in product 
presentation. <br>
TrustShield's impact extends to combatting Dark Patterns in User Reviews, rigorously scrutinising usergenerated content for manipulated or fake reviews. This commitment to review integrity significantly 
contributes to a more trustworthy online environment. Leveraging a dynamic technology stack that includes 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an engaging user experience, TrustShield's robust database collection 
integrates MongoDB, Firebase.React.js framework to ensure data integrity.Python's ML capabilities 
further secure information and enable serial ID recognition for product authenticity. 
Project objectives encompass the development of a precise Hidden Cost Detector algorithm, the 
implementation of a system for analysing and rectifying misleading product information, and meticulous 
scrutiny of user-generated content for manipulated reviews. TrustShield strives to raise awareness and 
cultivate an informed user base, simultaneously advocating for industry-wide adoption of ethical design 
principles. These collective efforts aim to drive a transformative shift towards a transparent, ethical, and 
trustworthy digital landscape. <br>
<h2>Expected Impact: </h2>
TrustShield's multifaceted approach seeks to revolutionise online user trust, providing a tangible impact on 
digital interactions. The Hidden Cost Detector ensures transparent transactions, mitigating the erosion of 
trust caused by obscured charges. Addressing Misleading Product Information contributes to informed 
decision-making, fostering trust in product presentation. By combatting Dark Patterns in User Reviews, 
TrustShield enhances the authenticity of user feedback, promoting a more trustworthy online environment. <br>
<h2>Conclusion: </h2><br>
In conclusion, TrustShield's innovative approach positions it as a pioneer in digital trust and integrity. 
Through the implementation of advanced technologies and ethical design principles, TrustShield not only
